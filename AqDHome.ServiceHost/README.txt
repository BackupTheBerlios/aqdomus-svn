AqDHome.ServiceHost

.NET service host, a powerful platform to host and manage persistent services
and remote objects.

The project is built for my university project - a distributed and intelligent
web search engine. However it's not a sub-project of the search engine, because
the platform will be useful for many other things (to see examples, run your
services.msc)
