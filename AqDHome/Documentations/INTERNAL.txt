- Rather than putting contents in separated pages, the software uses a
  Default.aspx to handle all requests, loading "EmPage" for specified content.

  EmPages themselves are special kind of user controls derived from
  "BaseEmPage". When an EmPage is loaded, its default stylesheet is also
  automatically referenced.

- BaseControl is the parent class of all User Controls. Its main goal is to
  solve the hassle of embeddeding html code inside ASP.NET Custom Controls.
  For examples, see BaseControl.cs

  BaseControl can only be used in Default.aspx and EmPages

- BasePage is the parent class for all dynamically-generated stylesheets
  (.css.aspx) and javascript files (.js.aspx), which are used instead of
  ordinary css and js to cope with the incompatibility between web browsers.

- All files are put under a 2-level directory structure.

    /bin              Store all DLLs. The directory should be set inaccessible.

    /Documentations   Store all documentations

    /StorageCode      Store code related to storage functions. Compiled to
                      /bin/AqdHome.Storage.dll

    /WebUICode        Store code common to all .ascx and .aspx. Complied to
                      /bin/AqdHome.dll

    /WebUIEmPages     Store all EmPages and their stylesheets.

    /WebUIImages      Store all images.

  The path to locate EmPages and images may be changed by modifying web.config
